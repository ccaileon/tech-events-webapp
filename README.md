# Tech Events Web App

A PHP-based web application for managing and displaying technology-related events. This project combines server-side scripting, file handling, and MySQL database integration.

**This project was developed as part of my learning process to practice working with PHP, files, and databases.**

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

Make sure you have **XAMPP** (or a similar local server) installed and running, so you can use **phpMyAdmin** to manage the MySQL database.

1. Open **phpMyAdmin** from the XAMPP control panel to verify MySQL is running.  
2. Go to the folder `data/database/` and run `createDataBase.php` via your browser to create the database.  
3. Finally, run `index.php` from your browser to start the app.
